I don't have to have an opinion about something.

I can just let it be. I can ignore it. I can realize it doesn't pertain to me, or I can just see it as it is.

I don't need to say that it's good or bad, fair or unfair. It just is. I'm gonna look at it as an objective piece of information. It doesn't need me projecting my thoughts, beliefs, or perceptions on it.

It is. You don't have to have an opinion about this.
