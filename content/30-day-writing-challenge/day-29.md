Regret makes me sad, but I believe that is what made me stronger and who I am today.

Actually almost nothing I regret because I believe regretting something that has happened is pointless. In my opinion, there is nothing to regret as long as the experience became a lesson.

I focus more on today and tomorrow.

But, if there is something to regret, maybe the answer is **time**.

Time cannot be repeated and changed. Therefore, I will feel regret if the time that has been given it still feels less.

For example, I may have spent time with someone, but who would have thought that it would be our last meeting. There may be no future encounters due to different paths or already different worlds.
