This is the first post in a series of #30DayWritingChallenge. I consider this article as a warm-up because it has been a long time since written on a blog. Each day there will be a different topic or discussion that might stimulate me to another topic or discussion. There are no fixed rules such as how many words the minimum, or what the topic should be written. Whatever comes to mind, that's what I'll write. The essence is to practice consistency.

So, let's start.

Things I learned when I just joined Bukalapak was:

## Vanilla

In my previous job, I always used jquery as the main tool when coding. So when I first joined Bukalapak, I needed to learn the basics of javascript code again without using any libraries. I needed to start using `document.querySelectorAll('.my #awesome selector')` instead of `$('.my #awesome selector')`.

Actually, during the coding interview, there was a question that needed to be answered using only javascript. I thought it's only used during interviews. Turns out that it is also used every day.

## Vue

The framework used by frontend engineers at Bukalapak is Vue. Of course, in my previous job, I've never used any framework for web development. So Vue was a new thing for me at that time.

## Git and Github

The first time I knew about git was when I was at the end of college, which was in late 2015. At that time I had no desire to learn more about it because there was no need to use git, even in my previous job.

When I first joined Bukalapak, I didn't only learn about git commands, but also their implementation on Github. I remember the two commands I mastered first were `git pull`, `git push`, and `git status`.

## AGILE

I heard about AGILE for the first time when I was in my second year of college in 2013. At that time I heard it from my lecturer when I was taking RPL (Rekayasa Perangkat Lunak) class. Because at that time AGILE was a new thing, so my lecturer didn't really explain it in practice.

When I first joined Bukalapak, I not only learned about AGILE but got involved in it. I still remember my first experience doing a marketplace and how confused I was when my PM asked for story points for the story to be worked on.
