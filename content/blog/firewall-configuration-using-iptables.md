A firewall is a system or group of systems that establishes access control policies between two networks. In principle, a firewall can be thought of as a pair of mechanisms: the first blocks network traffic, the second allows network traffic.

A firewall can be used to protect a network from external attacks, but a firewall cannot protect against attacks that don't go through the firewall and attacks from someone on the same network, and a firewall cannot protect a network from poorly written application programs.

In general, firewalls usually perform the following functions:

* Packet analysis and filtering.
* Content and protocol blocking.
* Connection authentication and encryption.

In this time we will use iptables as a firewall configured on a PC that acts as a PC Router. For details, see [here](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=48dcd38b3e3b9734!727&authkey=!AE3pafFVghhxMXg&ithint=file%2cpdf).
