When we were kids, we had some kind of hairdo catalog, but it was a profession. Starting from doctors, pilots, astronauts, ministers, to the president. Astronaut is the profession I chose as a kid. The reason is simple because I want to see outer space and the stars.

Then when I moved to junior-high school, the desire to become an astronaut was changed by a doctor. In my thought, a doctor is a very noble job because it can heal the sick. In addition, I was influenced by several families who work in the health sector.

When I entered senior-high school, my parents bought me a Playstation 2. I always played it every day, morning until night. There was a time when I was playing GTA San Andreas and I thought "It's really cool that people made a game as complex as this, but very fun to play". From there I had the passion to become a game developer. I looked it up and came across the term "programmer". Since then I have wanted to become a programmer in order to develop a game.

When I entered college, I focused on learning to develop games. I joined the game development community on campus. I entered various game development competitions. I took the topic of game development for my final project. Until I finally graduated from college.

*Me and my final project*

Unfortunately, my first job didn't take me into the game development industry but instead became a regular IT staff. From that job I got the task of developing a website, so I needed to relearn some of the web technologies that I had learned in college. And after living it a few months, turns out I enjoy it.

As of this writing, I still enjoy my profession as a web developer.

As I got older, I realized that my passions from childhood until now are always changing. It doesn't mean that I have failed to find my passion many times. But I have succeeded to explore my passion many times.

Finding your passion is a never-ending journey. Currently, I work as a web developer in an e-commerce company, but maybe in the next few years, I will find another profession that I love. The key is to stay open.

All this time we think that the career path is going up, what if the career path is shifted to the side?
