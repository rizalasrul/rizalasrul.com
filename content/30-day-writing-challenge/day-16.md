First of all, I don't plan on resigning.

The new year is identical to the opening of the employee "transfer market". Some people may think of having a new job in the new year.

It actually made me think about what things made me decide to resign from my employer.

So here are the factors:

## When income is no longer sufficient.

The most logical reason. I know some people who are like this, and so am I.

Of course, the easiest factor to control is the cost of our living needs rather than our income from the company. But there is a possibility if it turns out that I can't control the cost of necessities because of several things.

Actually, we can just tell our manager about the condition and ask that our salary be increased. But if that doesn't work, then looking for opportunities elsewhere can be considered.

## When the industry where we work has no future.

Not only moving from companies, but we also need to move from industries. Because the stagnant industry indicates that our career will be like that. We'll not learn and develop if we remain in a stagnant industry.

I did this when I was working at the previous company. I worked in the FMCG industry, with the main business focus being the development of food and beverage products. As an IT guy, of course, technology is not the main thing.

I know that the way I can stay current with technology is to move to a tech company. Therefore I decided to quit and move to Bukalapak.

## The company suddenly changes its culture and becomes toxic.

A company culture that changes drastically may be rare, but the possibility exists. It could be due to a change in the top management structure, or a shift in business focus, and other external factors.

Cultural changes do not necessarily change the work environment to be toxic. But if so, then the working atmosphere will be very unpleasant. Every day we'll work with a resentful heart. That's when we can think about changing companies.

## Getting an extraordinarily good opportunity and probably not coming twice

Opportunity can take any form. It could be the opportunity to get a better position, the opportunity to get a much better salary, or the opportunity to learn something new that cannot be obtained at the current company.

Of course, all these opportunities can be obtained in the company now. But indeed there are times when the company can not fulfill it. For example, the opportunity to work with colleagues from other countries, where most companies now work from their own.

Please resign wisely.
