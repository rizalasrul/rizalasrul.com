I got this from a book I've read.

Some things you should never do:

1. Don't be overheard complaining even to yourself.
2. Don't put on airs about your self-improvement. Don't talk about it, but be about it.
3. Don't overindulge in eating or drinking. Moderation is key. We have two ears and one mouth for a reason.
4. Don't speak more than you listen.
5. Donâ€™t avoid difficulty.

Don't do these things, you'll have a good life.
