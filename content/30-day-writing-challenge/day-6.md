I'm not a manager. I wrote this based on my observations, reading books, and listening to some podcasts.

So this is what the manager wants from his subordinates:

1. Have professional responsibilities, so you don't need to be micromanaged.
2. Really understand KPI and OKR, and know how to achieve them.
3. Be by their side, not the opposite.
4. You are not "cancer" that spreads bad traits and atmosphere to the team.
5. High achievers - asked for something but you deliver more than that.
6. Willing to the extra mile. Not selfish - just thinking about your own work.
