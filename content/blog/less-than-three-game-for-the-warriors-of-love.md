Filling my vacation time, I had fun making mobile-based games for the Android operating system. Calculate the training using the Unity3D application version 4.3 which already supports 2D games. I call this game Less Than Three, or in Indonesian it means Less Than Three, or emoticon <3.

So this game tells about a boy who is chasing a girl he loves. In the process of his love struggle, there are several obstacles that the boy must go through to get the heart of the girl of his dreams. At the end of this game there will be a twist that makes the players of this game will be excited.

This game was built using the C# with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012. To be able to play this game on your gadget, you must have at least the Android 2.3.1 Gingerbread (API Level 9) operating system.

For the designs, there are some that I took from the internet because they are allowed to be downloaded. This game is also an adaptation of the Pretentious Game series.
