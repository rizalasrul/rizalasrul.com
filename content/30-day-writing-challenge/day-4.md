Learn is a term when we add knowledge and skills. Unlearn is a term when we intentionally forget the knowledge and skills we've learned. Relearn is a term when we re-add something we've forgotten before.

We unlearn for several reasons. It could be because the knowledge that we previously mastered is no longer relevant, or it could be because our current job is completely different from our previous job, so we need to unlearn something irrelevant.

So, here are things I unlearn from my previous job:

## IT support thing

*Trying to fix the network on a colleague's computer*

I used to be an IT support for the first three months. My responsibilities are simple: helping other departments when there is a problem with their device or network. But my day-to-day work is really overwhelming me.

The things I learned during those three months were simple networking, troubleshooting for devices such as printers and monitors, and some factory production equipment.

## Python and Pandas

My first task when I first joined the IT developer team was to create a dashboard to display production data. At that time I was paired with my seniors who had time to work on it. She previously used python as a programming language and pandas as a data analysis library.

## Jquery

After three months I asked my lead to be transferred to the IT Developer team. When I joined IT developer team, my job was mostly web development. At this point, I was first really exposed to javascript and jquery.

## Arduino

There was a moment when I was assigned to make a sensor for factory needs. Actually, I forget the details of what the needs are, but what I remember is that the sensor is to track a product to a certain point.

At that time we developed the sensor with the help of Arduino and some mini cameras (I forgot the term). We develop these sensors using a shell script and several libraries.

Hope you unlearn something irrelevant.
