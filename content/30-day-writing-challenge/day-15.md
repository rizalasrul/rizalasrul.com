It doesn't feel like I'm halfway through the #30DayWritingChallenge. Actually today I have no idea what to write about.

Then suddenly Facebook refreshed my memory with this old photograph.

It was taken around 2017 in front of my old office in Bandung. It triggers my memory to flashback to some interesting things and I miss from Bandung.
 
From that photo, I looked for some photos of me when I was still in Bandung. Here are some I could find:

## My old boarding house

I lived here for over a year. I spend the most time in this place, even on weekends or holidays.

## Gadobangkong Station

I used local trains to travel. The closest station to my boarding house is Gadobangkong Station, so I went there very often.

## Farmhouse

I once traveled alone to the Lembang. I still remember that at that time I used public transportation and moved from local trains to public transportation (angkot).

The first place in Lembang that I visited was the Farmhouse. By buying a ticket, I got one glass of milk and can visit every point in Farmhouse.

## Floating Market

After the Farmhouse, I went to the Floating Market using an angkot. Fortunately, the distance between the Farmhouse and the Floating Market is not too far, so I arrived in less than 15 minutes.

The most interesting thing about the Floating Market is a place to eat with several outlets located above a reservoir.

## Gasibu

On weekends in the morning, I usually go to Gasibu for jogging.

## Cattle farm in Pangalengan

My previous company owned a cattle farm located in Pangalengan. I've been there several times for stock opname event.
