Being a leader is difficult, at least that's how I felt when I was the class leader in senior-high school. I was also clueless at that time about why I became class leader, but clearly, I was not comfortable being in charge of something. It's different from not wanting to be responsible, let alone running away from it.

I just want to be mediocre.

I feel that I have participated in society by being a passive person because everyone has their role. Meaning, there are already other people who are active and willing to be in charge, so I can simply be a compliment in the society. If everyone is active and wants to lead, there will be chaos.

Unless my personal interests are "attacked", maybe I'll take action.

So, what can I do to make the world ideal for me and others? Participate in what I can and I believe in. For example, I don't like waiting for people who come late, so I shouldn't be late and make other people wait for me. Treat others the way you want to be treated.
