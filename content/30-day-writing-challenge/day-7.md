Today we get the majority of information is from social media. From these contents, we see many influencers or content creators showing luxury cars, traveling to expensive places, and even recently there is someone that showing off their ATM balance.

Not only that but there is also a lot of content about finance. Most of them are investments in certain stocks, day trading, even bitcoin mining which is currently happening.

Rarely talks about saving money.

Yup, I know investment return can make us rich. But whether an investing strategy will work, and how long it will work for, and whether markets will cooperate, is always in doubt. Results are shrouded in uncertainty.

Personal saving and frugality are parts of the money equation that are more in our control. If you view building wealth as something that will require more money or a big investment return, you may become pessimistic. The path forward looks hard and out of your control. If you view it as powered by your own frugality end efficiency, the destiny is clearer.

You can build wealth without a high income but have no chance of building wealth without a high saving rate. It is clear which one matters more.

Saving is very related to your ego. You can define savings as the gap between your ego and your income.

Hope we can be wealthy.
