New year, new resolutions, new goals.

This year I have no new resolutions. I just want to be better than what I have now.

In fact, I started the first day of the year with something ordinary. I woke up at dawn, continued to watch the Iron Fist series, until this morning when I wrote this.

I wrote this based on feedback from my wife, family, colleagues, lead, manager, and people I've interacted with.

Here are three things I need to improve.

## Too frugal

Saving is good, but if it's too much, it can also be difficult for you. Several times I've been reminded by my wife to buy something that might be a little more expensive, but of good quality.

I once bought a watch for under Rp100.000. I like this watch because apart from being cheap, the design is also good. But unfortunately the following year my watch broke and I had to buy another watch.

I think the ability to buy slightly more expensive items with better quality also needs to be trained. 

## Too multitasking to unimportant things

I realized that I often did things that could not have been done at the same time. Usually, after doing this I'll think too much and it will give me a headache.

## Stand out

Since I was in school, I was too lazy to show my skill. If the teacher asks a question in class and I know the answer, I'd rather pretend not to know than to raise my hand and be noticed by the whole class.

Either lazy, or I'm just shy.

This continues in work. Until one day my lead gave very good feedback. From there I began to improve myself and learned to give opinions or concerns when in public.

Happy new year. Hopefully, we can enjoy 2022.
