## Introduction

> "Wow, a lot of people are starting to plant this. Let's follow the trend!”

Suddenly three weeks later, three boxes of kale plants have grown hydroponically with a wick system. Then the plant died because the owner left the village and did not continue.

> “Yesterday, my office mate made a challenge to run a few kilos in a month. Tomorrow afternoon I'll run right away."

One week later at the office there was a meeting that dragged on, so that it was late at night and the mood for running was ruined. The next day, when I was in the mood, suddenly it started raining. Every day there is always a reason to procrastinate.

It's too easy to start something. Too few have the consistency to finish.

So that I don't get disappointed, failed, or embarrassed myself too often, I started self-reflection and understanding. Starting to realize that in some ways, I need to make a "whip" for myself.

There are at least two cases that can serve as examples.

## First: Start diligently writing on Medium

Actually, at the beginning of 2020, I have set a target to write one article a week, of which there will be at least 48 posts in 2020.

My intention to write is actually just to express what is on my mind, as well as a means for me to learn new programming technologies. And a few weeks ago I stopped writing for a long time, maybe about 3 months.

Then there was one incident that made my passion for writing appear again.

| <b>Testimonial</b>|

The message goes to my LinkedIn account. Little things like this can make a "whip" for me to start writing again. Who would have thought that my writing would find its audience.

I also shared a post on the tweet platform with the hashtag #xof48. Through that hashtag, I immediately committed to make 48 posts in a year. Although I don't know at the end of the year how many writings I'll be able to produce, at least I've set a target that can be achieved.

## Second: Running

Since last month my office mate initiated to hold a running challenge. We are free to set any target in a month, as long as the target is achieved. Some friends have set 10, 15, 20, 25, up to 100 km.

Me? Of course set the lowest target, 10 km in a month. For me, being willing to put on my shoes and leave the house is an achievement. Moreover, it wants to run up to 10 km a month.

Because my target is 10 km, and my time is 31 days. So I use a simple strategy that doesn't burden me. I aim to run four times a month, at any time, with a mileage formula of 1–2–3–4 (first run 1 km, second run 2 km, etc.). Alhamdulillah last month I reached the target of 10 km.

| <b>The result</b>|

This month my friend made another challenge. I added my running target as far as 15 km. But I plan to run beyond that. The cool term is: under promise, over deliver.

I plan to run once every two days, with a minimum distance of 3 km. Alhamdulillah, this month is still on target and I have run three times with a total distance of 12.45 km.

I can't imagine, last month it took me a month to cover a distance of 10 km. This month it's not even halfway, I've exceeded that. Hope this is a good start.

Most things in life need a process. Find our way to "whip" ourselves. Consistent for me, is one of the most overlooked skills. If we can be consistent, I believe we have a treasure that many people don't have.

Cheers to all of us who are still in the process. Enjoy it!
