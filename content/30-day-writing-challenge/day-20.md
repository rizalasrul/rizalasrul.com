You're busy, I'm busy, but how much of what we're busy with actually matters?

Ask yourself with everything you do and say, "is this essential?". Because most of what we do and say is maybe not essential.

Most of what we do is because people asked us to do it, people told us to do it, or that's how we've always done it. Do we actually need to do it?

If we found out we were dying tomorrow, would we keep doing it? Would we do it the way we're doing it?

So when you ask yourself "is this essential?", you eliminate so much of what you don't need to be doing. You get the double benefit of now doing fewer things better.

That's why you ask yourself this question, "is this essential?", "do I actually need to be doing it?", "am I doing it the way that it needs to be done?". And you ask this of everything you do, say, and think.
