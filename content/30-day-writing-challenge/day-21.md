You always have the option of having no opinion, meaning just wait and see.

You don't need to apply your judgement to something yet. It's not things that upset us, it's our judgement about them.

So just wait and see.

The future will reveal whether this is good or bad, it will reveal whether you know, all the facts yet.

Just wait and see. You don't need to have an opinion yet.

Just relax.
